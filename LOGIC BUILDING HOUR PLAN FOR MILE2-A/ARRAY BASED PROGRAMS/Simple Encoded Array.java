/*
Problem Statement
Simple Encoded Array
Maya has stored a few confidential numbers in an array (array of int). To ensure that others do not find the numbers easily, she has applied a simple encoding.

Encoding Used:
Each array element has been substituted with a value that is the sum of its original value and its succeeding elementâ€™s value:

arr[i] = original_value_of_arr[i] + original_value_of_arr[i+1]

The last element value is unchanged.

Example:
If encoded array is [7][8][6][16][12][3], original array would have been [2][5][1][7][9][3].

The first number is 2

Sum of originals: 2 + 5 + 1 + 7 + 9 + 3 = 27

Tasks:
Given the encoded array, write a function to compute:

The first original number

The sum of all numbers in the original array
